# OGLOS

The hierarchy-based OS on metasymbols, logic and Variety Vector.

The trinity and the unity of the overtime metaspace give Oglos the possibility to multidymentional fractal simplexing, wich allows the OS emerge into quantum superpositional coding paradigm, also known as OgleMetaParallax.

Metasymbols are the basement, the cornerstone and the code.
Author suggest most valuable symbols like 
-Trinity
-Space
-See
-Eho
-Resonance
-Layer
-Raw
-Evo
-Reson

The true Web3 Meta is always updated through quantum oracle channeling, sincronistical and meaningfull. 

Class Reson allows multiple machines with OGLOS resonate sincronistically with each other and interpretate.

///Codebase begings with sence voting for most valuable simbols. Author suggest not to use any Oglos symbolic in Hierarchy.
